# Aquarium_Object_Detection
Implemented object detection on aquarium dataset. 
## Introduction
This dataset consists of 638 images collected by Roboflow from two aquariums in the United States The Henry Doorly Zoo in Omaha (October 16, 2020) and the National Aquarium in Baltimore (November 14, 2020). The images were labeled for object detection by the Roboflow team (with some help from SageMaker Ground Truth). Images and annotations are released under a Creative Commons By-Attribution license. You are free to use them for any purposes personal, commercial, or academic provided you give acknowledgement of their source.

There are following types of classes in the data: fish, jellyfish, penguins, sharks, puffins, stingrays, and starfish. In most images, there is a combination of classes present.
